Boosting Techniques in machine learning

what is the use of boosting ?
Boosting is used to improve the model accuracy ..
It trains the sequence of weak models, to improve the prediction power. Each compensating the weakness of the predecessors.

there are 2 major algorithms that are being used in machine learning--
1) ADA Boost
2) Gradient Boost
